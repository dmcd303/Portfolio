Road Mpa of Future Improvements:

1: Implement a banner notification for the winner of the game.
How? To do this, a console log will need to be written to call the banner notification to alert the player that the game is over and a winner has been named.

2: Alert players of a draw
How? A console log banner notifcation would suffice here to notify players when a statistical draw is the only possible result and that they should re-start.
